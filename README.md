## Introduction

Flappy Cow is an iOS action game developed with Apple's native game engine SpriteKit. 

All sprites credited to https://github.com/cubei/FlappyCow. Which is an Android version of Flappy Cow

## Why another clone game

I wanted to explore Spritekit and its feature. That is why I decided to create a variation of Flappy Bird game. 

The difference? Random spider and log.

## How to play

Similar to Flappy Bird. Keep tapping the screen to increase altitude and avoid scary spider and random log.
